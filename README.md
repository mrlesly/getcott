**Scope:** users can add a cott, add a villain, add villain contact information, boycott the situation, and invite others to help boycott, and decide if the situation was fixed or not. The system will send an email to the villain. 

**Out of Scope:** the system will not send any other message to the villain, other message such as phone call, text message, or snail mail. Villains will not be able to respond to boycott. Victim will not be able to add proof, no like or dislike, no comments. 

**Walkthrough:** users will register using social media or regular, they will add the categories that interest them. Then they will be asked to add a cott, and under the input, they will see cotts that they can support. Users will add the cott category, villain, date and time, location, situation, sentencing, and remedy. Users can also support cotts by simply click support on the cott.

**Platform:** Web, iOS, Windows, and Android, Tablets, Tech Wears, Television

## Actors:
